### History

The [Carrington Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859) was a huge solar storm in 1859. During the event, auroras were visible as far south as the Caribbean and telegraph systems all over the world failed. Some telegraph operators reported that they could continue to send and receive messages even though their systems were disconnected from any source of electricity.

Between 1977 and 2014, the government of the Philippines waged an on-again-off-again campaign against a violent Islamic nationalist group known as the [Moro Islamic Liberation Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_Islamic_Liberation_Front) or MILF for short.

### Places

The [Eye of the Sahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richat_Structure) is an eroded igneous rock dome that looks like a giant eye when viewed from above. The effect is like something out of science fiction.


### Technology

In Vim, invoking the `gf` command while the cursor is over a file path will open that file in a new buffer.

In Rust, there is the `unreachable!()` macro. Fine. But there is also the (vastly superior) [`xkcd_unreachable!()`](https://docs.rs/crate/xkcd_unreachable/).
