I'm a software developer and engineering manager living in NYC.

I currently work at [Braze](https://www.braze.com) (formerly known as Appboy), where I manage the email engineering team. I joined them in 2014 as an early engineering hire and have helped build their product and grow their team.

In a prior life, I worked in the public sector as a policy analyst for the New York State Governor's Office. Before that, I studied history and philosophy at Swarthmore College.

You can find me around the internet on [Github](https://github.com/nwj), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/nwj_), and [Keybase](https://keybase.io/nwj). In general, I avoid most forms of social media.

I'm always happy to hear from people who share my interests. If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me at [nwillettjeffries@gmail.com](mailto:nwillettjeffries@gmail.com).
